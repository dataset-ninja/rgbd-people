**RGB-D Peoples Dataset** is a dataset for an object detection task. It is used in the surveillance industry. 

The dataset consists of 6798 images with 4700 labeled objects belonging to 1 single class (*person*).

Images in the RGB-D Peoples dataset have bounding box annotations. There are 2098 (31% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There are no pre-defined <i>train/val/test</i> splits in the dataset. Alternatively, the dataset could be split into 3 visibilities: ***fully visible*** (2418 images), ***partially visible*** (2282 images), and ***hidden*** (0 objects), or into 3 camera positions: ***center camera*** (2266 images), ***left camera*** (2266 images), and ***right camera*** (2266 images). Additionally, every image contains information about ***timestamp*** and ***track***. Moreover, images are grouped by ***seq***. The dataset was released in 2023 by the University of Freiburg, Germany.
